This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

* So maybe I have lists of things:  
  + thing 1  
  + thing 2  
  + tacos  
  + Ned Niederlander  


...and maybe there are tables involved:

name    | legs
--------|------
thing 1 | 4
thing 2 | 4
tacos   | 0
Ned Niederlander | 2

```{r}

library(ggplot2)

min( diamonds$price )

qplot( carat, price, data=diamonds, color=cut )
```


have you seen how expensive the diamonds are!??! the most expensive ones cost *$`r max( diamonds$price )` FFS!*
